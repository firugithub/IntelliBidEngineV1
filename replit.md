## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend uses React with TypeScript, Vite, shadcn/ui (Radix UI), and Tailwind CSS. It features a dark mode-first, enterprise-focused design with a "New York" style, information-dense layouts, comprehensive gradient styling, and vibrant color theming. The application is structured with a 9-menu navigation and includes dashboards for Executive Summary and Vendor Shortlisting, along with dedicated sections for Template Management, RFT Draft Review, Smart RFT Builder, and a Knowledge Base Chatbot. **Agent Progress Visualization (November 20, 2025)**: Agent-Driven RFT generation now features color-coded real-time progress indicators showing each agent's status with visual states - pending (gray circle), running (blue spinner), and completed (green checkmark) - with smooth transitions and colored backgrounds for enhanced user feedback during parallel generation.

### Technical Implementations
The backend is built with Node.js, TypeScript, Express.js, and Drizzle ORM (PostgreSQL). It provides RESTful APIs for managing core entities, file uploads, sample data, and configuration. Data is stored in a PostgreSQL database (Neon serverless).

### Feature Specifications
- **Multi-Agent Evaluation System:** Employs 6 specialized AI agents for objective vendor proposal evaluation, supporting document understanding, semantic matching, and dynamic scoring. **Atomic duplicate prevention** uses database-level unique constraints: `evaluations.proposal_id` (ensures 1:1 proposal-to-evaluation mapping) and `proposals(project_id, vendor_name, document_type)` (prevents duplicate questionnaire responses per vendor). Vendor response generation automatically updates existing proposal records with fresh Azure Blob Storage URLs on regeneration, ensuring ZIP downloads always reference current files. Implementation uses onConflictDoNothing for evaluations and updateProposal for proposal refreshes. Stuck evaluations can be manually recovered using the "Re-evaluate" button on Dashboard. Additional resilience: exponential backoff for API rate limits.
- **Vendor Response Diversity System:** Generates realistic, differentiated vendor responses using OpenAI GPT-4o with detailed aviation vendor personas. **Vendor Persona Library (November 24, 2025)**: System uses real aviation industry vendors (Amadeus IT Group, Sabre Corporation, SITA, Loylogic, Comarch, IBS Software, Accenture, Infosys, TCS, Aims, Lufthansa Systems, GE Digital, Airbus, Boeing) with unique market positions, technical approaches, strengths, gaps, and response styles. Each persona has differentiated scoring profiles across product, NFR, cybersecurity, agile, and procurement categories, ensuring diverse, realistic evaluation scenarios matching real-world procurement experiences. **Centralized Questionnaire Counts (November 25, 2025)**: All generation paths now use unified `QUESTIONNAIRE_COUNTS` constant from `smartRftService.ts` ensuring consistent question counts: Product (50), NFR (75), Cybersecurity (40), Agile (40), Procurement (20). This eliminates inconsistency across AI-Driven, Agent-Driven, Template Merge, and Mock Data generation modes. Vendor response generation leverages full persona characteristics including technical architecture, market position, innovation level, documentation quality, and compliance approach. Context-aware remark generation analyzes question topics (security, scalability, integration) and produces rich, vendor-specific responses. Dynamic compliance scoring uses tiered probability curves across the full 0.0-1.0 strength range (elite vendors 0.90+ get 82% Full scores vs weak vendors <0.30 get only 5% Full), ensuring clear differentiation visible in evaluations. **Procurement Questionnaire & Commercial Profiles (November 25, 2025)**: New 5th questionnaire type captures commercial terms for data-driven Cost-Benefit Analysis. Questions cover licensing models (perpetual vs subscription, per-user vs enterprise), base costs, implementation costs, maintenance & support SLAs, training costs, infrastructure costs, hidden costs (data migration, change requests), payment terms, volume discounts, TCO projections, and commercial flexibility. Vendor personas extended with `procurementStrength` (0-1 commercial competitiveness) and `commercialProfile` (licensing models, pricing tiers, SLA guarantees, payment terms). Premium vendors (Amadeus, SITA) offer higher costs with better SLAs; mid-tier vendors provide competitive pricing; challengers offer lower costs with flexible terms.
- **Smart RFT Builder:** Facilitates triple-path RFT generation: (1) **AI-Driven mode** with category-specific RAG retrieval per section, (2) Template merge with existing templates, or (3) **Agent-Driven mode** where 6 specialized AI agents generate expert-level RFT sections. **RAG Integration (November 20, 2025)**: Both AI-driven and Agent-driven modes now retrieve organization-specific standards from the knowledge base during RFT generation to ensure compliance requirements are incorporated. AI-driven mode generates 10 sections sequentially via `generateRftSection()`, each retrieving category-specific standards using `getSectionCategory()` helper (topK: 2). Agent-driven mode uses role-specific RAG queries enriched with keywords (security agent: "cybersecurity compliance data protection", procurement agent: "commercial terms pricing SLA", etc.) filtered by agent category (topK: 3). Standards formatted as "ORGANIZATION-SPECIFIC COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS" block matching evaluation pattern. Agent-driven mode requires only project name, business objective, and scope - no business case needed. Generates comprehensive RFT (DOCX/PDF) plus 5 Excel questionnaires (Product, NFR, Cybersecurity, Agile, Procurement) with domain-specific questions, all uploaded to Azure Blob Storage. **Product Technical Questionnaire**: When business case is provided, automatically generates a comprehensive DOCX questionnaire with 10 sections (Introduction, Architecture [Conceptual/Logical/Application/Roadmap], Deployment, Reliability, Security, Integration, Networking, Performance, Maintainability, Information & Data). Features **high-DPI context diagram** (3840x2880 pixels, ~11MP) embedded at 1800x1350 resolution (6"×4.5" at 300 DPI) showing stakeholders, channels, interfacing systems, and data assets in Section 2.1.1. **Separate PNG diagram** (Context_Architecture_Diagram.png, 3840x2880 pixels) is also included in download pack for maximum viewing clarity. Diagram uses Puppeteer deviceScaleFactor: 2 with 1920x1440 logical viewport, Mermaid config with 18px fonts and enhanced spacing for crisp, professional-quality output without blur.
- **Advanced AI Features:** Includes Compliance Gap Analysis, Auto-Generated Follow-up Questions, Smart Vendor Comparison Matrix, Executive Briefing Generator, and a Conversational AI Assistant.
- **Knowledge Base & RAG Infrastructure:** Utilizes Azure Embedding Service, Intelligent Chunking, Azure Blob Storage, and Azure AI Search for document ingestion, processing, and retrieval, organized by AI agent role for targeted knowledge. **OCR Toggle Feature (November 24, 2025)**: Admin-configurable OCR enable/disable setting provides dual-mode operation: (1) OCR Enabled - Uses Azure AI Search OCR skillset for extracting text from images and scanned documents (requires AZURE_COGNITIVE_SERVICES_KEY), (2) OCR Disabled - Direct text embedding approach bypasses skillset infrastructure, enabling production deployment without Cognitive Services configuration. Setting stored in systemConfig table, checked during skillset initialization and document ingestion. **Dual-Index Chatbot Querying (November 25, 2025)**: Knowledge Base Chatbot now queries both `intellibid-rag` (standard chunked documents) and `intellibid-blob-ocr` (OCR-processed documents with merged_text) indexes in parallel. Intelligent merge logic prefers OCR merged_text when it contains 3x+ more content than RAG chunks, enabling retrieval from image-heavy/scanned documents. Falls back to standard RAG chunks when text quality is sufficient. Perfect for finding content from presentations, diagrams, and scanned compliance documents.
- **Data Management:** Includes a mock data generation page for creating persistent RFT scenarios and evaluation reports, with documents stored in Azure Blob Storage.
- **Configuration Management:** Uses environment variables via Replit Secrets, with a centralized `ConfigHelper` and an Admin Config page for managing Azure connectivity and data operations.

### System Design Choices
The application is designed for production deployment on Azure App Service using custom Docker containers. It employs a multi-stage Docker build strategy for optimized image size. Special attention is paid to private endpoint connectivity for PostgreSQL, configuring DNS resolution within the Docker container and adhering to VNet integration requirements for Azure App Service. Database schema management is handled by Drizzle ORM. SQL setup files (`azure-database-setup.sql`, `azure-database-seed.sql`, `azure-database-indexes.sql`) are maintained for Azure PostgreSQL deployment and reflect all latest schema changes including atomic duplicate prevention constraints (updated November 19, 2025). **System Dependencies:** Product Technical Questionnaire generation requires Puppeteer system libraries (glib, nss, libX11, libxkbcommon, etc.) installed on November 20, 2025 to support Mermaid diagram rendering. **Docker Chromium Integration (November 24, 2025)**: Production Docker container now includes Chromium browser and Puppeteer dependencies (Alpine packages: chromium, nss, freetype, harfbuzz, ca-certificates, ttf-freefont, font-noto-emoji, fontconfig) to enable context diagram generation in Agent-Driven RFT mode. Environment variables `PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD=true` and `PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/usr/bin/chromium-browser` configure Puppeteer to use the system-installed Chromium instead of downloading its own copy.
