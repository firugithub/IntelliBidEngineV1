Excellent question — when you receive multiple vendor responses to an RFT, your **Evaluation Report** becomes the key document for governance, audit traceability, and executive decision-making.

A well-structured **RFT Evaluation Report** (used in enterprise or public-sector procurement) should have sections that clearly demonstrate **transparency, scoring methodology, risk insight, and final recommendation**.

Here’s a detailed, **enterprise-grade structure** you can use 👇

---

## 🧾 **RFT Evaluation Report Structure**

### 1️⃣ **Executive Summary**

### 2️⃣ **Background & Context**
