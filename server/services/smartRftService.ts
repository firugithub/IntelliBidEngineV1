- Use terminology appropriate to ${businessCaseExtract.scope} and industry context
- Reference relevant industry standards and regulations based on project requirements
- Use formal procurement language
- Make ALL content specific to ${businessCaseExtract.projectName} and ${businessCaseExtract.businessObjective}

  : `Since no specific requirements were provided, generate ${count} questions covering core product capabilities aligned with the project objective and scope.`}
The questions MUST reference the specific requirement details whenever available.

For example, if a requirement is "Real-time fleet tracking for 200+ aircraft":
✓ GOOD: "How does your solution handle real-time tracking and location updates for a fleet of 200+ aircraft simultaneously?"
✓ GOOD: "Describe your product's data refresh rate and latency for fleet tracking operations at scale."
✗ BAD: "Does your product support fleet tracking?" (too generic, yes/no)
✗ BAD: "What features does your product have?" (not tied to requirement)

Additional question categories to cover:
- Integration capabilities (mention specific systems from scope)
- User experience for the stakeholders mentioned
- Scalability to handle the scope described
- Product roadmap alignment with project timeline
- Support and training approach

Each question MUST be measurable and require detailed vendor responses with evidence.`,
    
    nfr: `Generate ${count} Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) questions that directly address the Risks and Timeline/Budget constraints below.

APPROACH:
1. For each Risk identified, create questions asking how vendors will mitigate that specific risk
2. Reference the Timeline (${businessCaseExtract.timeline}) and Budget (${businessCaseExtract.budget}) in performance/scalability questions
3. Tie NFR questions to Success Criteria where applicable

Example: If a risk is "Integration with legacy systems":
✓ GOOD: "What is your approach to integrating with legacy systems, and what performance impact should we expect?"
✗ BAD: "How do you handle integrations?" (too generic)

Cover these NFR categories with specific context:
- Performance requirements aligned with project scale
- Reliability needs based on identified risks
- Scalability to support the scope over the timeline
- Security requirements for the stakeholders involved
- Maintainability considering the project lifecycle
- Compliance with regulations mentioned in scope`,
    
    cybersecurity: `Generate ${count} cybersecurity and compliance questions tailored to the Stakeholders and industry context.

APPROACH:
1. Consider who the stakeholders are (${stakeholdersList}) and what data they'll access
2. Reference any compliance or regulatory requirements mentioned in the scope
3. Ask about specific security measures for the risks identified

Example: If scope mentions "customer data" and stakeholders include "passengers":
✓ GOOD: "How does your solution protect passenger personal data in compliance with GDPR and local privacy regulations?"
✗ BAD: "Do you encrypt data?" (yes/no, not specific)

Cover:
- Data protection for stakeholder groups mentioned
- Access control appropriate to organizational structure
- Compliance certifications relevant to the industry/scope
- Incident response for risks identified
- Security audits and penetration testing approach
- Data residency requirements if mentioned in scope`,
    
    agile: `Generate ${count} agile delivery questions aligned with the Project Timeline and Stakeholder structure.

APPROACH:
1. Reference the specific Timeline (${businessCaseExtract.timeline}) in delivery schedule questions
2. Ask about collaboration with the Stakeholders mentioned
3. Tie delivery methodology to achieving the Success Criteria

Example: If timeline is "6 months" and stakeholders include "operations team":
✓ GOOD: "How will you structure sprints and deliverables over the 6-month timeline to enable early feedback from the operations team?"
✗ BAD: "What agile methodology do you use?" (too generic)

Cover:
- Delivery approach aligned with project timeline
- Collaboration and communication with specific stakeholder groups
- Risk management for identified risks
- Quality assurance approach for success criteria
- Team structure and expertise for the scope
- Change management process
- Progress reporting frequency and format`
